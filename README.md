## Hi, I'm Alex

- I'm currently working on MATLAB software which finds optimal designs of experiments for a large collection of regression models and criteria using CVX and PSO algorithms
- In the future I'd like to create the same optimal design software in Python

When I'm not working on my research I am usually:

- Trying to get Archmage on [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/u/alexwiigs)
- Adjusting my neovim config
- Playing disc golf
