## Hi, I'm Alex

- I'm currently working on MATLAB software which finds optimal designs of experiments for a large collection of regression models and criteria using CVX and PSO algorithms
- In the future I'd like to also create optimal design software in Python
- I'm addicted to [boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev/dashboard), my neovim config, and disc golf
